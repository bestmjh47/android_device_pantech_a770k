Working Features: All!

Not working Features: None!

Ultimate Kernel(Linux-3.0.32) is included.

If you want to use your own kernel, you should replace wlan module(wlan.ko) built from your kernel source. And Wi-Fi will works fine! 

You don't have to patch cm10 source because I included some pantech-specific libs in this source.

I miss my IM-A770K... He is stucking in QHSUSB_DLOAD...
